# Sales Analysis and Visualization
The "Sales Analysis and Visualization Project" is a data-driven project in which you used Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data for a specific period. The project aimed to provide valuable insights into sales performance, profitability, and trends based on the provided dataset. Here's an overview of the key components of the project:
# Data Collection:
collected and imported a dataset containing sales-related information, including details about segments, countries, products, pricing, sales volume, and dates.
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure data quality and consistency. This involved handling missing values, formatting columns, and addressing any data anomalies.
# Data Transformation and Modeling:
Using Power Query in Power BI, you transformed and modeled the data to create a structured and informative dataset. This included adding calculated columns, aggregating data, and establishing relationships between tables.
# Key Metrics Identification:
identified key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to measure sales performance and profitability. These metrics likely included gross sales, discounts, cost of goods sold (COGS), profit, and profit margin.
# Data Visualization:
designed and created a variety of visualizations using Power BI's visualization tools. These visualizations included bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and tables to present data in a visually compelling manner.
